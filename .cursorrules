# TestCase Pro Development Rules

## Project Context
This is a production-ready Test Case Management System built with Next.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and SQLite.

## Architecture Patterns
- Use server-side rendering where appropriate
- API routes handle all database operations
- Client components for interactive UI
- Maintain separation between public and authenticated routes

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions (but we use Pages Router)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

## Security Requirements
- Always validate input on the server-side
- Use NextAuth for authentication
- Never expose sensitive data in API responses
- Use parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM handles this)
- Implement proper error handling

## Database Operations
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database queries
- Always use transactions for multi-step operations
- Respect foreign key constraints
- Use indexes for frequently queried columns

## UI/UX Guidelines
- Maintain the professional blue/purple color scheme
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Show loading states during async operations
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Use toast notifications for user feedback

## Testing User Flows
- Always start test cases with "Login with [Role]" as per user rules
- Follow the established folder structure for organization
- Maintain data integrity across test runs

## Component Organization
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over inheritance
- Maintain consistent prop naming
